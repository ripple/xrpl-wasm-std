//! # Current Transaction Retrieval Module
//!
//! This module provides utilities for retrieving typed fields from the current XRPL transaction
//! within the context of XRPL Programmability. It offers a safe, type-safe
//! interface over the low-level host functions for accessing transaction data, such as from an
//! `EscrowFinish` transaction.
//!
//! ## Overview
//!
//! When processing XRPL transactions in a permissionless programmability environment, you often
//! need to extract specific fields like account IDs, hashes, public keys, and other data. This
//! module provides convenient wrapper functions that handle the low-level buffer management
//! and error handling required to safely retrieve these fields.
//!
//! ## Field Types Supported
//!
//! - **AccountID**: 20-byte account identifiers
//! - **u32**: 32-bit unsigned integers
//! - **Hash256**: 256-bit cryptographic hashes
//! - **PublicKey**: 33-byte public keys
//! - **Blob**: Variable-length binary data
//!
//! ## Optional vs Required Fields
//!
//! The module provides both optional and required variants for field retrieval:
//!
//! - **Required variants** (e.g., `get_u32_field`): Return an error if the field is missing
//! - **Optional variants** (e.g., `get_optional_u32_field`): Return `None` if the field is missing
//!
//! ## Error Handling
//!
//! All functions return `Result<T>` or `Result<Option<T>>` types that encapsulate
//! the custom error handling required for the XRPL Programmability environment.
//!
//! ## Safety Considerations
//!
//! - All functions use fixed-size buffers appropriate for their data types
//! - Buffer sizes are validated against expected field sizes
//! - Unsafe operations are contained within the low-level host function calls
//! - Memory safety is ensured through proper buffer management
//! - Field codes are validated by the underlying host functions
//!
//! ## Performance Notes
//!
//! - All functions are marked `#[inline]` to minimize call overhead
//! - Buffer allocations are stack-based and have minimal cost
//! - Host function calls are the primary performance bottleneck
//!
//! ## Example
//!
//! Get sender Account and optional flags:
//!
//! ```no_run
//! use xrpl_wasm_std::core::current_tx::escrow_finish::EscrowFinish;
//! use xrpl_wasm_std::core::current_tx::traits::TransactionCommonFields;
//! let tx = EscrowFinish;
//! let account = tx.get_account().unwrap_or_panic();
//! let _flags = tx.get_flags().unwrap_or_panic();
//! ```
