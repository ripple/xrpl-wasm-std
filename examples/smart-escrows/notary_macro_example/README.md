# NFT Owner Smart Escrow

Smart Escrow example demonstrating compile-time XRPL r-address to hex conversion using procedural macros.

## Overview

This smart escrow unlocks when the account finishing the escrow is the same as the pre-programmaed notary account.
Otherwise, the escrow does not unlock.
