# Local CI Scripts

This directory contains bash scripts that mirror the GitHub Actions workflow defined in `.github/workflows/test.yml`.
These scripts allow you to run the same tests locally that run in CI, ensuring consistency between local development and
the CI environment.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup your environment** (run once):

   ```shell
   ./scripts/setup.sh
   ```

2. **Run all tests** (equivalent to the full CI pipeline):
   ```shell
   ./scripts/run-all.sh
   ```

## Individual Scripts

You can also run individual test suites:

### Core Development Scripts

- **`setup.sh`** - Install dependencies and setup the development environment
- **`run-all.sh`** - Run the complete test suite (all scripts below in sequence)

### Main Scripts

- **`build-and-test.sh`** - Build and test the native workspace, build WASM examples, and run craft
- **`build.sh`** - Build all examples (accepts `release` argument for release builds)

### Helper Scripts

- **`clippy.sh`** - Run Clippy linting on both native and WASM workspaces
- **`fmt.sh`** - Check Rust code formatting
- **`run-markdown.sh`** - Execute bash code blocks in Markdown files
- **`run-tests.sh`** - Run integration tests for examples and end-to-end tests
- **`host-function-audit.sh`** - Audit host functions against XRPLd (requires Node.js)

## Usage Examples

```shell
# Setup environment (run once)
./scripts/setup.sh

# Run quick checks before committing
./scripts/fmt.sh

# Run comprehensive tests
./scripts/run-all.sh

# Build in release mode
./scripts/build.sh release

# Run only clippy checks
./scripts/clippy.sh

# Run only integration tests
./scripts/run-tests.sh
```

## Environment Variables

All scripts respect the `RUSTFLAGS` environment variable. By default, they set:

```shell
export RUSTFLAGS="-Dwarnings"
```

This matches the CI environment and ensures warnings are treated as errors.

## Requirements

- **Rust**: Stable toolchain (installed automatically by `setup.sh`)
- **Pre-commit**: For running pre-commit hooks (installed by `setup.sh`)
- **Node.js**: Required only for host function audit script

## GitHub Actions Compatibility

These scripts are designed to work both locally and in GitHub Actions. The same scripts can be called from GitHub
Actions workflows, ensuring perfect consistency between local and CI environments.

## Troubleshooting

- **Permission denied**: Run `chmod +x scripts/*.sh` to make scripts executable
- **Pre-commit not found**: Run `./scripts/setup.sh` to install dependencies
- **Node.js required**: Install Node.js for the host function audit, or skip that script
- **WASM target missing**: The scripts automatically install the `wasm32v1-none` target

## Script Dependencies

```
setup.sh (run first)
├── build-and-test.sh
├── build.sh
├── check-wasm-exports.sh
├── clippy.sh
├── run-tests.sh
    └── ../build.sh (dependency)
├── fmt.sh
├── host-function-audit.sh (requires Node.js)
└── run-markdown.sh
```

**Note**: Pre-commit checks are handled by the GitHub Actions workflow using `pre-commit/action@v3.0.1` rather than a
local script.

The `run-all.sh` script runs all individual scripts in the correct order.
